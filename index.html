			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<div class="img"><img src="./img/project.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>My main project at the moment is </p>
			<p>I'm not an Open Source nutjob per se, as in my opinion everybody should be free to license his code under his terms. I have a <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/shuailong">GitHub site</a> where I plan to host all or at least most of my open source efforts.</p>
			<p>Furthermore I occasionally report and fix bugs in various mozilla projects, incl. Firefox or addon.mozilla.org.<br/>I'm also a volunatary addon editor, reviewing addons submitted to addon.mozilla.org before they can become public.</p>
					
			<h2>Paid Work</h2>
			<div class="img"><img src="./img/work.jpg" alt=""/></div>
			<p>I regularly receive offers to work on Extensions, Webapps or customizations to existing software.
			Being a student means that some extra money is always welcome, but also that my time is pretty limited. Not to mention that I'm not willing to relocate for a job at this time.</p>
			<p>So if you have some challenging short term projects and you're willing to pay appropriately then feel free to contact me.
			If you, on the other hand, have a trivial, long term, low budget project please don't bother contacting me. ;(<br/>
			Oh, and of course, I'm not a web-<em>designer</em>, as demonstrated by this very site.</p>
